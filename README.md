#BingeGuru
---------
BingeGuru starts with the premise that the way people are consuming television content is changing. With the widespread adoption of tape recording and then DVR's, tv viewers took control of *when* they chose to watch shows. The rise of on demand streaming services like Hulu, Amazon and Netflix has accelerated and expanded this trend. 

BingeGuru explores updating the decision making tools for 'what to watch' from simple lists of shows and descriptions to providing information more suited to emerging single session or everyday viewing habits. 

###Use
1) On the home page the user is presented with a set of filters for episode length and genre. ![alt tag](https://github.com/bingeguru/bingeguru/blob/master/public/images/README-step1.jpg)

2) The results page has information on total series length, episode length, and different times to watch series based on viewing frequency. ![alt tag](https://github.com/bingeguru/bingeguru/blob/master/public/images/README-step2.jpg)

3) Users may add shows to a cart above results  to compare different shows more easily.![alt tag](https://github.com/bingeguru/bingeguru/blob/master/public/images/README-step3.jpg)

4) A show detail page offers more information and links to streaming video providers. ![alt tag](https://github.com/bingeguru/bingeguru/blob/master/public/images/README-step4.jpg)
